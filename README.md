# small-risk-project

market_data.csv: contains minute by minute data on 50 US stocks for 3 months (only bid/ask prices are provided, not volumes).

orders.csv: contains the orders generated by the algo strategy, with information such as date, timestamp, symbol, order_status, price, side, quantity, order_id. The trades are contained in the orders with order_status = FILL.

The strategy is a simple pseudo directional alpha strategy trading several times a day in all the names with a horizon of about 30 minutes.

This project contains 3 parts

Market Risk
1. possible risk metrics to monitor the market risk of the cash equity strategy
2. calculation of risk metrics
3. risk metrics cal engine

Market Surveillance
1. possible metrics to detect misbehaviors of algo
2. calculation of one metric

Instead of a cash equity strategy, we have a new directional IV alpha trading algo for options. Brainstorm possible additional risk metrics.
